# Order Management System for Plastic Bag Manufacturing

## Overview

This project is an advanced order management system for plastic bag manufacturing. Its main purpose is to streamline manufacturing processes, improve decision-making, and provide a robust, user-friendly platform. Key capabilities include comprehensive order and production management, quality control, maintenance tracking, and HR management. The system aims to provide real-time tracking, multilingual interfaces, and efficient data processing to improve overall operational efficiency and decision-making.

## User Preferences

- Language: Arabic (RTL) with English fallback
- Error handling: User-friendly messages in Arabic
- Logging: Comprehensive server-side logging for debugging
- Code style: Consistent TypeScript with proper type safety

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modern stack emphasizing efficiency and scalability, with a strong focus on Arabic RTL design principles.

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless) managed with Drizzle ORM.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Prioritizes Arabic RTL design, features a centralized toast notification system, IconWithTooltip for accessibility, and enhanced loading states with skeleton loaders.
- **Technical Implementations**: Includes comprehensive number formatting (Arabic numerals, 2 decimal places for weight, 1-2 decimal precision for percentages), sequential ID generation, and integrated attendance and notification systems. Query optimization utilizes indexed foreign keys, aggregate functions, and grouping. Real-time updates are managed via TanStack Query with 30-second refetch intervals, cache invalidation on mutations, and optimistic updates.
- **Feature Specifications**:
    - Multilingual support (Arabic/English).
    - Real-time order tracking and management.
    - Advanced production order management, including detailed product specifications and notes.
    - **Three-Machine Roll Tracking**: Tracks each roll through film/extruder, printing, and cutting stages.
    - **Material Mixing System**: Formula-based mixing system using size and thickness ranges, and master batch colors. Categorized by machine screw type ('A' or 'ABA'). Ingredients sourced from items table (CAT10 - raw materials).
    - Quality control systems.
    - Maintenance tracking, including spare parts management.
    - HR management with attendance tracking and training programs.
    - **Geolocation-Based Attendance**: Attendance check-in system with GPS verification within factory premises (500m radius) using the Haversine formula. Supports multiple factory locations.
    - Role-based access control (Admin, Production Manager, Film Operator, Printing Operator, Cutting Operator).
    - **Replit Auth Integration**: Dual authentication support (traditional username/password and Replit Auth).
- **System Design Choices**: Features role-based access control, comprehensive order and production management, real-time inventory and warehouse tracking, and integrated quality/maintenance monitoring.
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Implemented with global error boundaries on the frontend, comprehensive error logging and graceful responses on the API, transaction safety and connection resilience for the database, and intelligent retry with exponential backoff for network operations. Detailed Arabic error messages are provided for specific scenarios.
- **System Integration**:
    1.  **Warehouse**: `inventory`, `inventory_movements`, `items` tables.
    2.  **Orders**: `orders` linked to `production_orders`.
    3.  **Production**: `production_orders` linked to `rolls` and `warehouse_receipts`, managing a three-stage workflow (Film → Printing → Cutting → Warehouse).
    4.  **Material Mixing**: `mixing_formulas`, `formula_ingredients`, `mixing_batches`, `batch_ingredients`. Includes an `Inventory Consumption API` for automatic stock deduction.
    All sections maintain referential integrity via foreign keys, real-time cache invalidation, and transaction-safe operations.

### Enhanced Attendance & Location Verification System (December 6, 2025)

**Security Improvements:**
- **GPS Accuracy Verification**: System now validates GPS accuracy before allowing attendance check-in
  - Maximum allowed accuracy: 100 meters
  - Rejects low-accuracy readings with user-friendly Arabic error messages
  - Logs accuracy warnings for monitoring
- **Mock Location Detection**: Detects attempts to fake GPS location
  - Records violations in `violations` table with severity level
  - Blocks check-in and logs detailed device information
- **Timestamp Freshness Check**: Ensures location data is recent (within 5 minutes)
- **Device Information Logging**: Records IP address, User-Agent, and timezone for audit trails

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend (`server/routes.ts` POST `/api/attendance`):
  - Validates accuracy, coordinates, and timestamp
  - Handles undefined accuracy gracefully
  - Stores `location_accuracy`, `device_info`, `distance_from_factory` in attendance records
- Frontend (`client/src/pages/user-dashboard.tsx`):
  - Sends enhanced location data (accuracy, timestamp)
  - Client-side validation before API call
  - Shows accuracy status (high/medium/low) with badges

**User Experience:**
- Clear Arabic error messages for each validation failure
- Real-time GPS accuracy display with color-coded badges
- Refresh location button for users to get better readings
- Warnings when GPS accuracy is low

### Unified Mobile & Desktop Navigation System (November 19, 2025)

**Architecture Overhaul:**
- Created centralized navigation configuration system with role-based access control
- Implemented unified `PageLayout` component that replaced legacy Header/Sidebar/MobileNav pattern across 30+ pages
- Built responsive `MobileShell` component with dual navigation:
  - **Quick Actions Bar**: Bottom bar with 4 high-priority items (priority ≤ 4)
  - **Hamburger Drawer**: Full navigation menu grouped by categories with role-based filtering

**Components:**
- `navigationConfig.ts`: Single source of truth for all routes with role permissions, priorities, and grouping
- `PageLayout.tsx`: Wrapper component that embeds Header, Sidebar, and MobileShell automatically
- `MobileShell.tsx`: Mobile-first navigation with Sheet drawer and fixed bottom actions bar
- Updated `Sidebar.tsx` to consume navigationConfig for consistency

**Migration Details:**
- Migrated 30+ pages from old pattern: `<div><Header/><Sidebar/><MobileNav/><main>...</main></div></div>`
- To new pattern: `<PageLayout title="..." description="...">...</PageLayout>`
- Eliminated duplicate navigation logic across components
- Ensured consistent padding (pb-24) for mobile navigation clearance
- Operator dashboards support `hideLayout` prop for embedding in tabs

**Benefits:**
- Single, consistent navigation experience across all devices
- Role-based filtering applied uniformly
- Reduced code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Improved mobile user experience with quick access to priority features
- Easier to add new pages (just update navigationConfig.ts)

**Technical Notes:**
- All navigation filtering uses `canAccessRoute()` helper for permission checks
- MobileShell groups routes by category (أوامر الإنتاج, الإنتاج, الجودة والصيانة, etc.)
- PageLayout provides consistent structure without nested div complexity
- User confirmed mobile experience works correctly

### Film Production Auto-Completion & Order Progress Indicators (November 19, 2025)

**Film Production Auto-Completion:**
- Enhanced `createRollWithTiming` in `server/storage.ts` to auto-complete production orders when:
  1. Total produced quantity (`produced_quantity_kg`) reaches or exceeds final quantity (`final_quantity_kg`), OR
  2. Last roll is explicitly marked (`is_last_roll = true`)
- On auto-completion, system automatically:
  - Sets `film_completed = true`, `is_final_roll_created = true`, `status = "completed"`
  - Calculates and stores total production time (`production_time_minutes`)
  - Records production end time (`production_end_time`)
  - Sets `film_completion_percentage = 100`

**Order Management Progress Indicators:**
- Fixed progress calculation in `OrdersTable.tsx` to show accurate stage-based completion percentages:
  - **Film Stage**: `(produced_quantity_kg ÷ quantity_kg) × 100` - Reflects actual roll production
  - **Printing Stage**: `(printed_quantity_kg ÷ quantity_kg) × 100` - Reflects rolls that completed printing
  - **Cutting Stage**: `(net_quantity_kg ÷ quantity_kg) × 100` - Reflects final cut and packaged quantity
- Each indicator now independently tracks its respective production stage
- Uses weighted average when order has multiple production orders

**Technical Implementation:**
- Progress indicators use actual stage quantities from `production_orders` table:
  - `produced_quantity_kg`: Total weight of all created rolls
  - `printed_quantity_kg`: Total weight of rolls that completed printing
  - `net_quantity_kg`: Total net weight after cutting (excluding waste)
- Base comparison quantity: `quantity_kg` (ordered quantity from customer)

### Production Monitoring Dashboard Enhancement (November 18, 2025)

**Major Updates:**
- **New Backend APIs**: Added 5 section-specific endpoints for production monitoring:
  - `GET /api/production/stats-by-section/:section` - Section-wide production statistics
  - `GET /api/production/users-performance/:section` - User performance metrics by section
  - `GET /api/production/machines-production/:section` - Machine production data by section
  - `GET /api/production/rolls-tracking/:section` - Roll tracking and search by section
  - `GET /api/production/orders-tracking/:section` - Production order tracking by section

**Storage Layer:**
- Added 5 new methods to `IStorage` interface and `DatabaseStorage` class
- Implemented section mapping (`film` → `SEC03`, `printing` → `SEC04`, `cutting` → `SEC05`)
- Handled schema inconsistency between `sections.id` (varchar) and `users.section_id` (integer)
- All queries filter by production department users (role_id = 2) and specific sections

**Technical Notes:**
- Section filtering uses mapped section IDs to handle varchar/integer mismatch
- Queries join rolls → machines → sections for proper section-based filtering
- Default date range: last 7 days if not specified
- Search functionality supports roll numbers, production order numbers, and customer names

**Future Considerations:**
- Schema migration recommended to standardize all `section_id` references to `varchar(20)`
- Would eliminate casting and improve query performance
- See architect review for detailed migration plan
