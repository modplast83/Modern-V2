-- Phase 1 — Orphan rows audit (READ-ONLY)
-- Run with:  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f .local/audits/orphan-rows-audit.sql
-- Goal: count rows whose *_id columns reference a non-existent parent row.
-- These tables currently have NO foreign key constraints, so silent orphans
-- are possible. Do not run this on production with heavy traffic.
